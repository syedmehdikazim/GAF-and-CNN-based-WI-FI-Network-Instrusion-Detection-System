# GAF-and-CNN-based-WI-FI-Network-Instrusion-Detection-System
The description of my research paper to tackle network intrusion and the code that I have written.

GAF (Gramaina angular field):-
A Gramian Angular Field (GAF) is an image obtained from a time series that represents some temporal correlation between each time point . It provides a way to preserve temporal dependency since time increases as the position moves from top-left to bottom-right . There are two methods available: Gramian Angular Summation Field and Gramian Angular Difference Field . can also be used to generate patterns in case of non temporal dataset

WIFI intrusion detection system:-
A Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) is a technology that monitors the radio frequency (RF) spectrum for unauthorized or unexpected wireless transmissions and/or activities . It can be used to protect a wireless network or a wired network from rogue access points or other security threats . A WIDS can also detect and locate wireless personal electronic devices (PEDs) and trackers that may pose a risk to data-sensitive or critical facilities .

The AWID (Aegean Wifi Intrusion Dataset) dataset is a project that aspires to act as a solid base for providing tools, methodologies, and datasets that will aid researchers in developing robust security mechanisms for the current and next generations of wireless networks . The well-known AWID2 dataset is comprised of a large set of packets (F) and a smaller one. The AWID3 dataset is a project that supplements and extends the well-known AWID2 corpus by capturing and studying traces of a wide variety of attacks hurled in the IEEE 802.1X Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) environment . It focuses on WPA2 Enterprise, 802.11w, and Wi-Fi 5 . It contains multi-layer and modern attacks, including Krack and Kr00k . The dataset is available in pcap and CSV format 

we are doing a binary classification using CNN, all the different attacks are labeled as 1 while the non attacks as 0.
